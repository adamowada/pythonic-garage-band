# 401 Lab 04: Pythonic Garage Band

### Description:

This is practice with python's OOP. There is a main class Musician, and 3 subclasses (Guitarist, Bassist, and Drummer) that extend Musician. Each Musician object has a solo, and each subclass has an instrument. Finally, there is a Band class with a band name, and members. The Band class has a class variable for previous bands, and a class method to list the previous bands and their members. The Band class also has an instance method for each member to play their solos.

Additionally good practice is followed with each class having its own docstring, __str__, and __repr__ methods.
